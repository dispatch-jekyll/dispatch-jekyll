# Dispatch for Jekyll

Will publish and generate fast and free websites for your content.

It's a Content Publishing System, powered by Jekyll.

## Fundamental Goals

1. Provide a clean user experience for managing content and creating a website from nothing.
2. Allow for easy writing and editing with a minimal interface.
3. Completely abstract away from Jekyll and Git interfaces, and remove the learning curve required to learn these platforms.
4. Generate fast and free websites for users.

## Development Branch Documentation

### master

The stable state of the project. May be minimal or empty for a bit.

### working

The working state of the project, including design in process, features undergoing revisions and content. Most issues will be addressed and solved here.

### backend

Contains backend code for connecting to and interacting with the GitHub API. ~~To setup locally, you will need to configure a virtual host with the url `juic.ms`, as this URL is the one that's configured with our application on GitHub. This is subject to change in the future.~~ **under review**
