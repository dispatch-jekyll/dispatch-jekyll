#juic
publishes your content

juic.ms is available, which could be cool.

It's a Content Management System, powered by Jekyll.

## Fundamental Goals

1. Provide a Clean UX/UI for managing content.
2. Completely abstract away from Jekyll and Git interfaces, and remove the learning curve required to learn these platforms.

##Development Branch Documentation

### userflow

contains the frontend experience of what it's like to use this service. This is considered the UI of our project. Static HTML and CSS will give us a feel of the experience.

### backend

Contains backend code for connecting to and interacting with the GitHub API. To setup locally, you will need to configure a virtual host with the url `juic.ms`, as this URL is the one that's configured with our application on GitHub. This is subject to change in the future.
