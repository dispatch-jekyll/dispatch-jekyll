<h2>This is a much longer post title</h2>

<span class='description'>Jun 16th, 2013</span>
<p>
  This is the body of the text. You can click here to edit. Viewing an individual post is no different from editing an individual post. Everything is always saved. <em>Always.</em> However, you might want to publish your post. Presumably, clicking publish will make a commit, so the post will be live.

<p>I was thinking of not having a save button at all, but that might be confusing for users.</p>
